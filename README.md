## Overview :writing_hand:
this is a page where it shows us a list of the first 20 episodes of Rick & Morty where we see the first 10 characters that participated in the episode.
Link deploy : https://

### Installation :gear:
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/TatianaIng96/rick-morty.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd rick-morty
 ```
3. Install the dependencies: 
```shell
 npm install i
 ```
4. Start the application: 
```shell
 npm run dev
  ```
The application will automatically open in your default web browser, ready for exploration.

### The Challenge :weight_lifting_man:
 the challenge is to make requests in parallel to have the data of the episodes and characters and after this make a transformation 
 to obtain a page where it shows us the list of first 20 episodes of Rick & Morty where we see the first 10 characters that 
 participated in the episode, we just want to see the name and species of the character.

## My Process :mountain:

During this project, I gained valuable insights in the following areas:

* Setup: Created the project using Vite with the React template. Set up the basic file structure.
* Component Design: Designed the tasklist and task components, including their layout and functionality.
* Styling: Used Sass for styling to create a visually appealing and responsive design.
* Task Management: Implemented the logic for adding and completing tasks. Completed tasks are automatically moved to the "Completed Tasks" list.
* Testing: Thoroughly tested the app for different use cases and edge cases to ensure smooth functionality.

### Built With :hammer_and_wrench:
The project was built using the following technologies:

* React
* Sass
* TypeScrpit
* Vite

### What I Learned :microscope:
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:

* Creating a responsive and user-friendly interface using React components.
* Managing and manipulating state in React using hooks and context.
* Integrating TypeScript for type-safe development.
* Using Sass to enhance the styling process and maintainable CSS code.
* Working with Vite to optimize the development workflow.

### Continued Development :briefcase:
While the current version of the app is functional, there are several areas for potential improvement:

* Data Persistence: Implementing data persistence using a backend or browser storage for task persistence across sessions.
* Drag and Drop: Adding drag-and-drop functionality for task reordering.
* User Authentication: Introducing user authentication to allow multiple users to manage their own tasklists.
* Customization: Allowing users to customize the app's appearance and behavior.

### Useful Resources :sos:
During the development of this project, the following resources were helpful:

* Official React documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs
* Official Sass documentation: https://sass-lang.com/documentation
* TypeScript Documentation : https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/
